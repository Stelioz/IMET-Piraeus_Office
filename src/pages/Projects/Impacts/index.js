                  Public transport (PT) has been supporting the mobility of all within the urban fabric. For
                  instance, people living in a city move to meet each other, commute to their activities, and
                  visitors move for sightseeing. Passengers choose it because it is well-fitted in the urban
                  environment, cost-effective and safe. Even if passengers know that it is a safe way to move,
                  the decreasing comfort due to overcrowding or funding allocation, limited services digitalization,
                  difficulties to consider the needs of different target groups and outdated reporting mechanisms
                  create an urban space of reduced perceived safety. On top of this, the pandemic has enhanced distrust.
                  All the above discourage the use of PT, and thus, destroy opportunities of multimodal mobility,
                  resources saving, traffic reduction, while it restrains future mobility from citizen feedback. At
                  the same time cities, transport providers and Urban Mobility third parties focus merely on digital
                  trip services and do not address citizen safety perceptions and wellbeing, while fail to collect and
                  extract knowledge from citizen feedback. IMPACTS envisions a human-centric PT where passengers feel
                  safe, support fellow travelers, and contribute with their feedback to an innovative PT.

                  The IMPACTS project focuses on the development, implementation, testing and commercialization of
                  connecting and reporting innovations in PT. IMPACTS also focuses on the bottom-up community-based
                  innovations in existing critical urban mobility infrastructure that can have a dramatic impact on
                  how we move in our cities. IMPACTS aims to:

                    <li>Connect passengers in ad-hoc communities to create supportive spaces, enable passengers to report issues, create trust using rating mechanisms, and encourage behavior change through stimulating analytics.</li>
                    <li>Enable cities and transport providers to receive real-time insights regarding passenger perception, exploit new feedback channels and extract knowledge.</li>
                    <li>Deliver a new approach to public transport, applicable to other cities, enhancing the attractiveness and effectiveness of PT. Pilots in a megacity and a suburban area as well as the recognition of business opportunities aim to demonstrate the scaling up potential.</li>
                    <li>Foster the use of public transport in EU and other regional cities and communities, contributing to the delivery of better mobility services for citizens, feedback management, traffic reduction, environmental effectiveness and better use of urban space.</li>
